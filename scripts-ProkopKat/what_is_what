Whats is what

1) module pyMolecular (by prokop Hapala) - for processing output from DFT:
- atomicUtils.py	
- plotUtils.py
- elements.py

2) scripts for adding ligands onto the surface of silicon nanocrystal:
-	replace100_file.py	
-	replace111_file.py	

3) script that takes the DFT cp2k output (cp2k.out file and .MoLog file) and processes them into Fourier transformed molecular orbitals that can be plotted as band structure
- kspace_density_off_GX.py
- kspace_density_off_GL-invert.py (same as the *GX.py file, but for different k-lines)
- plot_klinesGX.py (plots the band structure along GX line)
- plot_klinesGL.py (plots the band structure along LG line)

4) script that takes the DFT cp2k output (cp2k.out file and .MoLog file) and processes them into transition probabilities
- dipoleTrans_grid_Kat.py
- dipoleTrans_grid_Kat_small.py (same a s above, but for small clusters, where there is not enough states)

5) script that takes data generated by the scripts above and plots them (or prints out the info) in convenient way
- plotStuff_Kat.py
- plot_dos.py
- charge.py
- ratesHOMO-LUMO.py
- thermalized_rate.py
- thermalized_rate_allT.py

6) scripts that plot the bond length histogram our of the .bas file (so first we convert .xyz to .bas by x2b.py and then process)
- x2b.py
- bas2bondlength_Kat2.py
- print_all_bonds.py
